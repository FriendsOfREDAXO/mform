# MForm - REDAXO Addon

![Poster](https://github.com/FriendsOfREDAXO/mform/blob/assets/mform8.png?raw=true)

MForm facilitates the creation of REDAXO module inputs. With MForm, you can not only create forms, but also visually design them exactly to your own specifications thanks to flexible templates. It allows you to create all standard REDAXO form elements and includes several extra widgets that can be easily integrated into modules.

**But it doesnâ€™t stop there!** 
MForm also enhances YForm and rex_form with additional widgets. Need a custom link field or a chic image list? No problem, MForm has you covered.

## New in Version 8
The highlight of the latest version? The brand-new Form Repeater! This feature replaces the old MBlock AddOn and offers the ability to not only repeat form elements but also nest them at multiple levels â€“ something that was not possible with MBlock. This allows for the construction of even more complex forms.

The included **demo collection** allows for immediate testing of module codes. Modules can be directly installed and tested. The codes are all commented.
And additionally, there is a comprehensive documentation ðŸ“’.

## Features

### Basic Functionalities
- **Creation of module inputs via PHP**: The foundation for working with MForm.
- **Multi-column forms**: Layout options for structuring the forms.

- **Continuous MBlock Compatibility**: Ensures compatibility with existing MBlock installations.
- **Module examples for direct installation**: Provides ready-to-use templates for various use cases.

## Form Repeater

The Form Repeater allows dynamic repetition of form elements while realizing nesting at multiple levels.

### Migration from MBlock to MForm 8 

***MBlock Module*** 

```php
// Base ID for managing form elements
$id = 1;

// Initialize MForm
$mform = new MForm();

// Add a fieldset
$mform->addFieldsetArea('Team member');

// Add a text field, referring dynamically to a JSON format
$mform->addTextField("$id.0.name", array('label' => 'Name'));

// Add a media field saved by MBlock in JSON
$mform->addMediaField(1, array('label' => 'Avatar'));

// Output the form with MBlock, which allows dynamic handling of blocks
echo MBlock::show($id, $mform->show(), array('min' => 2, 'max' => 4));
```

***The same module in MForm 8*** 

To determine the necessary field keys, a dump might be needed beforehand. 
Note: From the original MBlock Mediafield 1, it becomes: `'REX_MEDIA_1'`

```php
// Repeater initialization ID with the base ID of the original MBlock section
$id = 1;
// Create a new MForm instance with the factory method and directly integrate a repeater
echo MForm::factory()
    ->addRepeaterElement(
        $id, 
        MForm::factory()
            ->addFieldsetArea('Team member', 
                MForm::factory()
                    ->addTextField('name', ['label' => 'Name'])
                    ->addMediaField('REX_MEDIA_1', ['label' => 'Avatar'])
            ),
        true, 
        true, 
        ['min' => 2, 'max' => 4]
    )
    ->show();
```
